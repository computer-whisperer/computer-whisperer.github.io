Every control system we build has monumental room for improvement, and each summer I strive to learn better ways to do things.
In the process of designing Smaug, I started to experience the difficulties involved in true autonomous navigation. Taking a simple motorised system and making it do a specific task involved far more than a simple "goto(x, y)" command.
Recognizing after last year that a simple PID loop didn't seem to quite accomplish the task, I spent the summer learning about superior methods, such as trapezoidal and s-curve motion profiles.

Erebor features the first fully holonomic drivetrain my team has built. Using mecanum wheels, we can perform any combination of rotation and translation simultaneously.
This feature was crucial to creating a full-field navigation system within my capabilities. I used trapezoidal motion profiles to drive the robot through precise x, y, and theta coordinates to complete the autonomous routines.
