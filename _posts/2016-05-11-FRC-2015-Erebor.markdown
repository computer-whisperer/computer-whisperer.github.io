In the following season, the game demanded an autonomous mode that was capable of much more than driving in a straight line, and I was ready for this. I built a system capable of driving the robot through any number of coordinates on the field using trapezoidal motion profiles. Due to my inexperience with control theory, I made a number of mistakes that caused many headaches. But I was learning. Driven by a passion to keep improving, I took a college Calculus class, enabling me to better understand how true optimal control algorithms work.
