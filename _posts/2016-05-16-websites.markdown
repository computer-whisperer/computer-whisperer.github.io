Over my high-school career, I have built a total of four distinct websites.


# Team 4819 V1

The first substantial website I built, [team4819.com](team4819.com), was a site for my FRC team. The original version featured a custom-built dynamic loading system, 
only downloading the specific components necessary to display each new page. It also featured custom user logon, blog posting, and media upload systems. For a time, it 
also functioned as the team's e-mail blaster, forwarding team updates to any e-mail accounts in the users system.


# Michael Engineering V1

Michael Engineering is the primary sponsor for my robotics team. After the owners saw the website I built for the team, they offered me an internship. One of my projects 
there was to update their website, and this is what I came up with. [michaelengineering.com](michaelengineering.com)


# Team 4819 V2

A few years after I built the first website for team 4819, it needed a redo. I took this opportunity to build it on top of Wordpress so that members of the team could 
continue maintaining it when I move on in life. Since I built the first one in 2013, I had learned many things about visually-pleasing web design, and incorporated these
into the final product. It will replace the existing [team4819.com](team4819.com) in the next few weeks.


# Michael Engineering V2
Ever since I first got involved at Michael Engineering, I had believed that their website could use a complete redesign. After years of band-aids, I finally took the 
opportunity to re-build the site on Drupal 8. With this base, the company can continue adding content when I move on in life. It will replace the existing 
[michaelengineering.com](michaelengineering.com) in the next few months.
